# We had a problem of loading large json files as well as rendering web pages fast with the given amount of data.

## Main goal is:
  - Optimize program to load large.json file within 1(one) minute.
  - Find out how we ca n render schedule pages faster

## Tools I used to solve the problem:
  - gem pghero
  - newrelic
  - gem activerecord-import
  - gem strong_migrations
  - benchmark
  - apache benchmark testing
  - siege

## For given feedback loop on database level I did the following:
  - desided to start with `small.json` in order to increase feedback loop
  - extracted logic from rake tasks in it's own class so that it's easier to test.
  - wrote test for loadeing `.json` files
  - by implementing any changes on database level I made sure tests are passing and my metrics from new relic and benchmark metrics show better results

## Let\'s look at `Benchmark.measure` numbers showing the following:
- CPU time 
- system CPU time
- the sum of the user and system CPU time
- the elapsed real time. The unit of time is seconds.

#### Initial results of running `be rake 'import_json_benchmark[fixtures/small.json]'`:
```
 2.654352   0.956313  13.612620 (14.781368)
```

#### Results  of running `be rake 'import_json_benchmark[fixtures/small.json]'` after optimization and using `gem oj`, `gem activerecord-import`, adding necessary indicies:
```
1.585816   0.067304   1.655319 (1.651922)
```

#### This improvement allowed me to load `fixtures/large.json` file with the following metrics:
```
 33.660827   0.582401  34.245360 (40.213537)
```

As we can see from the results above after getting rid of partials and rendering partial with collection
- Time taken for tests reduced from 247.233 seconds to  45.169 seconds
- Time per request reducded from 24723.295 [ms] (mean) to 4516.931 [ms] (mean)
- Requests per second increased from 0.04 [#/sec] to 0.22 [#/sec] (mean)



On the screenshots below we can observe that slowest queries and transactions metrics were improved as well:
